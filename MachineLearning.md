### Collecting and analyzing data
#### Training set
	* The labeled data - The target answer that you want to predic. 
	* Variables/features - These are attributes of the example that can be used to identify patterns to predict the target answer.
#### Test set
Evaluating data	

### Feature processing
### Training & Evaluating
#### Classification
Given training set (x,y), we want to create a classification model f(x) that can predict label y for a new x
The machine learning algorithm will create the function f
The predicted value of y for a new x is sign(f(x))
#### Improving model accuracy
#### Using the model to make predictions

### Retraining models on new data
